A simple tutorial to make scatter plot using R. 

*We need to install ggplot using the following command:*
install.packages("ggplot2")
*Then load the package using the following command:*

We will use one of the data sets comes with ggplot package to make scatter plots.
Once, we load ggplot package, we can use R functions:
1. ggplot(), which can be used to initialize the plotting system with data,
2. aes(x= and y= ) to add variables,
4. color= and fill= to add color to shapes
5. (geom_point()) is to create a scatter plot of x = Sepal.Length by y = Sepal.Width
